    "4. Power Service: Service Power is more uniformly distributed but doesn't have much variation in the data\n",
    "5. Sea Temperature: Primarily influenced by the season of the year, and equitorial position of the ship, is uniformly distributed except for a peak on the right side indicating sligh skewness probably due to stronger summer season in one of the locations\n",
    "6. Boiler Fuel Flow: Consists of a tall box and a tiny peak at the higher end of fuel flow rate. Most of the usual operations happen in between 0-10L/h fuel flow. Rarely, on days of extreme weather or rough operations\n",
    "7. Incinerator: Majority of the waste removal operation happens with a lower fuel requirement, except for some extreme cases. These could be during docking for extra cleaning/occassional discharge cleaning.\n",
    "8. Diesel Generators: Substantiate a 2-3 peaks highlighting a 2-3 modes of operation, including traveling against currents/winds requiring higher throughput\n",

    "12. Draft: maintained constantly between 7.5 and 8 metres, shows buoyancy control and build quality of the ship\n",
    "13. Relative Wind Speed: The wind speed is aligned in favor to the ship movement by aligning the direction of sail\n",
    "14. Speed through water/over land: Indicates 2 modes, one low rangee where the ship is either docking, anchoring or sailing in shallow waters. The second peak which is not so frequent indicates high speed motion. Among these, Speed through water has higher peak on greater end of speed spectrum because the ship has to move against the water many a times.\n",
    "15. Trim: A uniform and normally distributed trim is maintained indicating well-planned design execution throughout the operation\n",
    "16. Propulsion power has 4 peaks, indicating 4 ranges of operation. It is well spread out with variation, higher power being demanded probably when the ship is leaving from docks and is on shallow waters.\n",
    "17. Thrusters: Limited operating ranges with 0-0.1 MW consumed in maneuvering primarily\n",

    "- On the long-term front, with seasonality in play: we can observe from the monthly chart that for warmer conditions of water, more power is consumed. \n",
    "- This totally makes sense as the water would be less dense and the ship would have to work generate thrust to move through it\n",
    "- The effect is not fully observed in the Fuel Efficiency chart as lower density also means lower resistance to move through water. \n",
    "2. KPIs vs Speed over Ground\n",
    "- Total Power Required increases with Speed over Ground\n",
    "- Fuel Consumption per nautical mile has increases consistently with speed (between 6&8, 12&17)\n",
    "- Coming to Power Specific Fuel Consumption, no visible pattern can be seen"

    "1. I first remove the columns not necessary for analysis like 'End Time' and 'Vessel Name'\n",
    "2. Further, from the above analysis it is also determined that some columns are very highly correlated. If two columns are correlated at > 0.9, only one is kept for the analysis\n",
    "3. If the distribution of a column is very narrow, it doesn't offer any variation as a feature. Hence we remove that also from the analysis\n",
    "4. None of the features used to generate the KPI can be used for forecasting as it will be linearly dependant by inherent nature\n",
    "5. Therefores, in the SARIMAX Seasonal modeling and forecast, I take an approach to try and forecast the total power from external factors that can be pre-planned before the cruise starts based on weather forecasts and other requirements\n",
    "6. Finally, this is concluded with some simple hyperparameter tuning for better AIC value (Penalizing method for addition of a new feature to the model) to get the best performing forecast\n",
